# AutoCode.AutoCore

The Auto Code's Auto Core framework provides basic data structures, algorithms, and utilities that would be useful for project development as for other requirements for future API in the Auto Code framework.

This framework will have basic utilities:
 - Basic algorithms and Data structures
 - Basic Design patterns and interfaces
 - Wrapping IO
 - Basic Reflection API
 - Creating Properties and Pseudo-Objects
 - Creating Object Templates
 - And more to come

All Data structures will be in the **com.raos.autocode.core.ds** package
 - These will be concrete classes which implement/extend certain required algorithms

All Algorithms will be in the **com.raos.autocode.core.algorithm** package
 - These will either be abstract classes or interfaces which provides the utility
 
All Design Patterns will be in the **com.raos.autocode.core.design** package
