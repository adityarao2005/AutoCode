# AutoCode
The Auto Code framework: Framework to reinvent the wheel - Inspired by the Spring Framework

First, we will be building a framework to specialize in Basic Project Programming Principals (Mostly of this (Implement the Basic Design Patterns)) and any additives like Graph Theory. This will become our Core Framework and will have all the useful utility functions required to build furthur.

List of Potential Projects:
 - Auto Core - Core features and functionality for the AutoCode framework
 - Auto Deep - Competitive Programming features for people interested in graph theory and Dynamic programming
 - Auto AI - AI framework
 - Auto Math - Math and Function parsing along with computation of derivatives and integrals (normal way or through Riemann sums)
 - Auto Class - Features provided for AOP and bytecode manipulation
 - Auto Net - Extended API for accessing resources across the NET and socket programming
 - Auto HTTP - Extended API for accessing resources across Net specifically HTTP
 - Auto UI - GUI framework
 - Auto Security - Security framework
 - Auto Data - Database framework and Connectivity
 - Auto Graphics - Graphics framework for Auto UI
 - Auto Game - Game Library for Auto UI and Graphics
 - Auto Web - Creation of servers and servlets
 - Auto Expr - Expression parsing
 
 
This is my last big project from highschool and is going to be a project which I hopefully continue into University.
