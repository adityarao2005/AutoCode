# AutoCode.AutoMath

The Auto Code's Auto Math framework provides basic mathematical parsing and expression solving through its powerful math library. It contains various math functions such as the regular addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, exponentiation, logarithms, trignometry, all the functions useful for highschool mathematics.
The framework also allows you to get the result of these functions in exact or approx form and has the capability of using derivatives and integration.
Note that these framework is only good for scalar equations, and in later releases, support for vectors, parameterized curves, deltas and gradients maybe included.

This framework will have basic utilities:
 - Math expression parsing
 - Math expression evaluating
 - Differentiation and Integration
 - Solving expressions using factoring and other techniques (Newtons method)
